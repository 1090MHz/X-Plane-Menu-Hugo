Welcome to **X-Plane-Menu-Hugo**!  
This site is built using the Hugo framework and styled with the AltitudeDark theme, designed to replicate the look and feel of the X-Plane menu system. Featuring clean menu separators and nested submenus, the design ensures a seamless and intuitive navigation experience, inspired by the aesthetics of X-Plane's interface.
